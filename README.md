## Get started

Hello, fellow microblogger! 👋 This plug-in is available as BETA in the official directory. It's easy to install, but be aware that it's early in development. So bugs and weird things will happen. 😅 Thanks for your help with testing.

### Install the plug-in

1. Find [Search Space in the plug-in directory](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/).
2. Choose the site you want to install the plug-in to.
3. Press *Install*.
4. Congratulations, the plug-in is installed.

### Do your first search

After installing the plug-in, you should have a new page at `/search-space/` within a few minutes. So, for example, if your blog is at https://dahlstrand.net/, the address is https://dahlstrand.net/surprise-me/.

1. Go to that page.
2. Search for whatever is on your mind. Good luck! 🕵️

### Ensure replies are included on your Micro.blog

Search Space searches your posts *and* replies. But, for this to work, you must include replies on your Micro.blog.

1. Go to [Account](https://micro.blog/account).
2. Scroll down to *Replies*.
3. For *Include my replies on*, choose your blog (not *Timeline only*).
